# Speed and Distance Predictive Analysis

### Introduction to dataset
The data gives the speed of cars (mph) and the distances (ft) taken to stop. The cars data set that comes with R by default

### Objective:
To fit the linear model:distancei = Î²0 + Î²1speedi + i, in order to predict the distance travel by any car given the speed 

### Project methodology
- Data gathering and accessing 
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Predictive Analysis
